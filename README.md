## Poetry crap

```bash
$ poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
Warning: poetry-plugin-export will not be installed by default in a future version of Poetry.
In order to avoid a breaking change and make your automation forward-compatible, please install poetry-plugin-export explicitly. See https://python-poetry.org/docs/plugins/#using-plugins for details on how to install a plugin.
To disable this warning run 'poetry config warnings.export false'.
```

```bash
$ poetry self add poetry-plugin-export
```
